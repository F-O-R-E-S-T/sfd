If you want to play the project, you can download the file called "OS Quest.rar", it will contain some files that will work to run the executable, look for the file with the .exe extension and open it, from there, the game menu will appear and you can start playing.

If you want to use the project, you only need the unity version 2022.3.25f and open the folder located in the repository directly from Unity HUB or from the engine.
